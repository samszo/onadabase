Here is the code that allowed me to convert shp files 
with coordinates in Lambert II étendue
to
kml files with WGS84 coordinates.

index.php allows you to see how your shpfile is organized.
		as the dbf part of your data have specific fields you might want to retrieve 
		some of them in your kml file.

indexkml.php allows you to convert your shp file to kml.
